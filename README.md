# VBA-challenge
For this project I created a VBA script to loop through all the stocks for each year from 2014 to 2016 and output the following information.


The ticker symbol.


The yearly change for each ticker symbol from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


The percent change for each ticker symbol from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


The total stock volume of each stock.



The VBA Script is provided in the files section as well as the screenshots for each year.
