# VBA-challenge
For this project I created a VBA script to loop through all the stocks for each year from 2014 to 2016 and output the following information.


- The ticker symbol.


- The yearly change for each ticker symbol from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


- The percent change for each ticker symbol from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


- The total stock volume of each stock.



The VBA Script is provided in the files section as well as the screenshots for each year.
